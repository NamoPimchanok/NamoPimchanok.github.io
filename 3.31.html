<h2>Magnetic storage media</h2>
<p>Magnetic storage media depends on the magnetic proporties of the material. Magnetic
    material is coated on the surface of a disk or tape that can be magnetised in such a way
    as to represent a 1 or a 0. Many hard disk drives are made up of more than one disk and 
    these disks are known as <strong>platters</strong>. Each platter is made from 
    glass, ceramic or aluminium coated in a nickel alloy that can be magnetised.

<h2> Fixed/internal hard disk drive (HDD)</h2>
<p>Fixed hard disk drives are available on all computers and are the main method
used for data storage. On a PC this is usually a fixed hard drisk with read/write heads 
allowing data to be written to or read from the disk surface. the disk surface is coated in 
a magnetic film that allows data to be stored by altering the magnetic proerties to represent binary
1s and 0s. The hard disks usually store the disk operating system (DOS) and other system software,
as well as applications software and files. Applications software (such as spreadsheet and words processors)
also needs a hard drive to allow them to quickly get and save data.</p>

<h3>Uses</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To store operating system and working data/ files</li>
    <li>Storing applications software that needs fast retrieval and storage data</li>
    <li>Used in real-time systems</li>
    <li>Used in file servers for computer networks</li>

<h3>advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>They have a very fast data transfer rate and fast access time to data</li>
    <li>They have very large memory capacities</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
    <li>Can be easily damaged if the correct shut down procedure is not carried
        out. (can lead to a head crash which would result in a loss of data.)
    </li>
    <li>They have many moving parts when compared to, for example, solid state
        drives (SSDs)
    </li>
    <li>Their read/write operatuin can be noisy compared to SSDs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Portable hard disk drives</h2>
<p>These devices work the same way as fixed hard drisk drives but usually connect to the computer
    via the USB (univeral serial bus) oirt and can be disconnected and used on different
    computers. The disks are generally capable of storing more data than the equivalent optical
    disk (CD, DVD etc)
</p>
<p>use</p>
<ul>
    <li>used as backup system</li>
    <li>used to transfer data/files/ software between computer</li>
</ul>
<p>advantages</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data access time and data trasfer is very fast</li>
    <li>large memory capacity</li>
    <li>Can be used as a method of transferring information between computers</li>
</ul>
<p>disadvantage</p>
<ul>
    <li>Can easily be damaged if dropped or subhected to strong magentic field; as with fixed
        hard drives, and incorrect shut-down procedure could also lead to loss of data
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Magnetic tapes</h2>
<p>A magnetic tape is a very thin strip of plastic that has been coated in magnetic layer.
    They are read and written to by a read/write head. The data is stored in magnetic areas 
    that represent 1s and 0s. Data is read from the tape using serial access. This type 
    of storage is useless in a real-time situation (because of it's slow speed) and is more
    suited to offline or batch processing.
</p>
<p>use</p>

<ul>
    <li>In applicationswhere batch processing is used, for example, clearing bank cheques,
        utility billing and producing pay slips; in these applications there is no need for any
        specific processing order and speed of data access is not essential
    </li>
    <li>Used as a backup media since all the data needs to be stored</li>
    <li>Used in long-term archiving of data; magnetic tapes have huge data storage
        capacities and are known to be very stable, which makes them ideal for long-term
        storage.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Advantage</p>
<ul>
    <li>they are less expensive (per byte) thaan the equivalent hard disk</li>
    <li>Very robust technology (does not deteriorate very much over time)</li>
    <li>The data transfer rate is actually fast (not the same as data access time, which is 
        very slow for magnetic tapes)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>disadvantage</p>
<ul>
    <li>Very slow data access time</li>
    <li>When updating, another tape is needed to store the final updated version</li>
    <li>They are affected by magnetic fields; a strong magnet can corrupt data stored
        on the tape
    </li>
</ul>
