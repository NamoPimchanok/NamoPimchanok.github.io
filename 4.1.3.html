    <h2>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h2>
    <h3>How computers use Wi-Fi and bluetooth to connect to network</h3>

    <h3>Wi-Fi</h3>
    <p>A wireless transmitter (WAP) receives information from a network, it's connection
        (for example a broadband connection if the internet is used). This transmitter converts
        the received information into the radio waves and then transmits them. A device for example
        a computer, recives the radio waves from an installed wireless adaptor which allows it to 
        download the information from the data source. This works in reverse when the device wants
        to transmit data over the network. Wi-Fi is best suited to operate full-scale network 
        because it offers a much faster data trasfer rate. 
    </p>
    <h3>Bluetooth</h3>
    <p>Bluetooth sends and recives radio waves in a band of 79 different frequencies (also 
    known as channels). They are all centred on a 2.45 GHz frequency. They don't interfere with
    other fecices since each communicating pair uses a different channel (from the 79 options).
    When a device wants to communicate, it picks one of the 79 channels randomly. If the channel
    is being used already, It then randomly picks another channel. This is known as
    spread-spectrum frequency hopping. To lower the risk of interfering with other devices,
    the communication pairs constantly change the frequencies they are using. 
    <ul>
        <ol>When transfferring data between two or more devices that are very close together
            (30 metre distance</ol>
        <ol>when the speed of data transmission is not critical</ol>
        <ol>for low-bandwidth appolicaations (for example, sending music files form
            mobile phones to headsets.)</ol>
    </ul>
