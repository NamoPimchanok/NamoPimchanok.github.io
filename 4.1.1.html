    <h3>Modems</h3>
    <p>Modems means "modulator demodulator" and is designed
        to convert a computers digital signal for transmission
        over an existing telephone line.

    <h3>Hubs</h3>
    <p>Hubs are hardware devices that can have multiple of devices or computers connected 
        to it. Most commonly they are used to connect together a number of devices to for a 
        LAN.

    <h3>switches</h3>
    <p>Switches are similar hubs however are more efficient in the way that they
        distribute data packets. The switch checks the data packet receided and work out its
        destination address. It sends the data to the appropriate computers only. Each device 
        on a network has a media access control (MAC) address that addresses it.

    <h3>bridge</h3>
    <p>Bridges are devices that connect one LAN to another LAN that uses the same communication
        rules. They are often used to connect together different parts of a LAN so that they can
        funtion as a single LAN

    <h3>Router</h3>
    <p>Routers enable data packets to be routed between the different networks, for example
        to join a LAN to a area network(WAN). A rounter would have an interent cable pplugged
        into it and several cables connecting to computer and other devices on the LAN.
